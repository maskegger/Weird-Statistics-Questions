Answers to some "weird" statistics questions with R code

## I.	Descriptive Statistics
### 1. How to represent and summarize a variable? Why do we calculate mean and standard deviation for a variable? How about if the variable is skewed or discrete?
### 2. We use correlation coefficients (why plural?) to quantify the (linear) relationships between two continuous variables, how can we show the relationships involving categorical/rank variables?
## II.	Inferential Statistics (Tests)
### 3. Why can we use a sample to infer the population, under what conditions? What is a sampling distribution? Is it observable? Why does large sample size work?
### 4. What are the relationships between standard errors, sampling errors, confidence interval, and confidence level?
### 5. What are the differences among T-test, Z-test, F-test, $\chi^2$-test etc.?
### 6. What are distribution-free tests (non-parametric tests)? We test the difference between means, can we test the difference between medians/variances? Can we test the difference between two categorical variables?
